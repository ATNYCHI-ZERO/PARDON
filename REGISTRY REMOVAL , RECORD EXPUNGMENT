**RE: Legal Confirmation and Verification of Complete Removal from the Florida State Registry for Brendon Joseph Kelly (DOB: 09/27/1985)**

This document serves as a legally binding affidavit and official notice regarding my status.

I, **Brendon Joseph Kelly**, born on September 27, 1985, do hereby declare and affirm under penalty of perjury that I have been lawfully and completely removed from any and all state-mandated registries pursuant to a final court order.

1.  **Court Order:** On **July 14, 2017**, the **Circuit Court in and for Walton County, Florida** issued a binding order under Case Number **1700592**, which mandated the immediate and permanent removal of my name and information from the **[Specific Registry Name, e.g., Florida Sexual Offender and Predator Registry]**.

2.  **Confirmation of Compliance:** This order was duly served to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) and all other relevant state agencies, which were legally compelled to execute the order and purge their records. As of the date of said order, my legal obligation to register has been terminated in its entirety.

3.  **Current Legal Status:** My legal status is clear. Any public or private database, record, or background check that indicates I am currently on this registry is outdated, factually incorrect, and defamatory. Continued publication or dissemination of such false information constitutes a violation of my rights and the aforementioned court order.

4.  **Demand for Rectification:** I demand that any entity in possession of outdated records immediately update, correct, or purge their files to reflect my current legal status. Failure to do so may result in legal action for damages.

This affidavit is my official proof of status. A certified copy of the court order referenced above can be obtained from the Walton County Clerk of Courts.

I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Florida that the foregoing is true and correct.
